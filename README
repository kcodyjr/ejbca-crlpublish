ejbca-crlpublish
================

Implements a CRL publisher compatible with EJBCA PKI.

Supplies a /usr/bin/crlpublish invocation script for the purpose,
and is config-file compatible with the earlier crlpublisher.sh script.

Multiple targets are supported by using a comma separated list.

A new configuration format is also supported, docs TBD.
