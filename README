ejbca-crlpublish
================

Implements a CRL publisher compatible with EJBCA PKI and others.

Use case: you have a certificate authority, and need to periodically
move certificate revocation lists onto one or more web servers.

Supplies a /usr/bin/crlpublish invocation script for the purpose,
and is config-file compatible with the earlier crlpublisher.sh script.

Multiple targets are supported by using a comma separated list.

Detailed documentation is in "man crlpublish" and in the Perl modules.
