ejbca-crlpublish
================

Implements a CRL publisher compatible with EJBCA PKI and others.

Use case: you have a certificate authority, and need to periodically
move certificate revocation lists onto one or more web servers.

Supplies a /usr/bin/crlpublish invocation script for the purpose,
and is config-file compatible with the earlier crlpublisher.sh script.

Updates are atomic. New CRLs are pushed to a temporary file on the 
target hosts, and moved into place. Multiple targets are supported
by using a comma separated list.

crlpublish checks the CRL on the remote host before publishing, and
ensures the new crlNumber is higher than the old. This avoids problems
caused by inconsistent queuing. The openssl binary is required on the
remote host for this sanity check to work.

Detailed documentation is in "man crlpublish" and in the Perl modules.
